This is next js 14 project.

Steps to create a basic Next.js project
- Installation and Setup
  Install the latest LTS version of Node.js from the official website. To confirm the installation and to check the version installed run the command "node -v".
- Creation
  To start installation of a new Next.js app run the command "npx create-next-app app_name" or "npm create-next-app app_name" or "yarn create-next-app app_name". After running any one 
  of the afore mentioned commands, answer a set of questions with a simple Yes or No, namely would you like to use Typescript/ESlint/Tailwind CSS/`src\` directory/App Router/customise 
  the default import alias to complete the process.
- Run the application
  Once the installation process of our basic Next.js project is done we can run the command "npm run dev" or "yarn dev".
